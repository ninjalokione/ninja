    <P>I will be expressing myself through pictures, blog maybe Vlogs and more. 
        What I am up to, what games I am playing, which tv or movies ive watched and rank them.</P>
    <p>A little bit about myself is, I am unemployed stay at home dad. I have a 1 year old daughter who
        is the light of my life. I enjoy playing video games, making music"(even though I'm not very good), 
        taking photos and videos. I also am a decent cook, so if you want to see some food I make I can show that as well.
        Traveling is one of my goals, I would love to travel all over the world and experience new cultures. 
        I've been dealing with depression, trying to figure out what to do with my life, so I guess this is my 
        autobiography to see if I ever get there.
